# Deep_Learning_Handwritting_Recognition

### Goal
This project is my first approach in order to create an end to end process will will recognise the handwritten part inside an image and predict the word depicted. 

### Description
The main steps that will be followed are:
1) Create an algorith which will distinguish the handwritten part from images through Image and Natural Language Processing techniques.
2) Find the exact location of each handwritten character depicted.
3) Train a Deep Learning Neural Network classifing the character.
4) Evaluate the model in the whole word depicted in each image.

### Libraries: 

The neccessary libraries will be available in the requirements.txt file.
